Project Title: Eat-Da-Burger!
* Eat-Da-Burger! is a restaurant app that lets you input the names of burgers you like to eat.  Whenever a you submits a burger's name, the app will display the burger on the left side of the page -- waiting to be devoured.  Each burger in the waiting area also has a `Devour it!` button. When you clicks it, the burger will move to the right side of the page.  The app will store every burger in a database, whether devoured or not.

Prerequisites
 * You will need to install the following npm: 'mysql', 'body-parser', 'express-handlebars`, 'express'.
